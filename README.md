# Excercise Finder App (Unstyled Version)

This app was built as an educational exercise on my stream on 05/11/2025.
It uses only HTML and Javascript, with Bootstrap for styling and Supabase as the backend database.

**If you want to understand the logic of how this app works, head to the unstyled version for clearer code and detailed comments!**
